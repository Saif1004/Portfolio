It features email-based alerts, device status monitoring, and a dashboard to control sensors (like door locks or motion detectors) from any browser.</p>\n<p>One challenge was handling reliable two-way communication between the UI and hardware endpoints. This was addressed by implementing polling and WebSocket fallbacks to ensure commands and sensor data remained in sync. Security was also a focus â€” user roles and encrypted credentials were built in from the ground up.</p>\n<p>This project demonstrates practical IoT integration, full-stack architecture, and a focus on real-world usability.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{}},
