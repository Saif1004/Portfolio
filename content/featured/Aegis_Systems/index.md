A mobile smart security app that lets users register, manage, and authenticate access to secured environments using face and fingerprint verification. Designed for Raspberry Pi integration, the system enables secure, real-time control and monitoring through a dedicated mobile interface.

Built with React Native (Expo) for the frontend, Flask for the backend API, and Firebase for authentication and user data storage. The app allows admins to register new users by capturing their face and fingerprint, view logs of access attempts, and unlock the door only after dual biometric verification.

Key features include live camera integration for face capture, serial communication with a fingerprint sensor, time-based access logging, and role-based access control. Designed for reliability in offline-first environments, this project demonstrates practical edge-device security, full-stack biometric verification, and mobile-first usability.
