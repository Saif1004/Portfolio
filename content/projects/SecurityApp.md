A full-stack smart security system that combines real-time alerts, device control, and user authentication to monitor and protect physical spaces remotely.

The system includes a responsive React frontend, a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, and MongoDB for storing user credentials, device states, and logs. It features email-based alerts, device status monitoring, and a dashboard to control sensors (like door locks or motion detectors) from any browser.

One challenge was handling reliable two-way communication between the UI and hardware endpoints. This was addressed by implementing polling and WebSocket fallbacks to ensure commands and sensor data remained in sync. Security was also a focus â€” user roles and encrypted credentials were built in from the ground up.

This project demonstrates practical IoT integration, full-stack architecture, and a focus on real-world usability.
